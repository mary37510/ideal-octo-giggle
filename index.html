        <p>
            What do you think about our big family dinner?
            Your mum said that it is not good for everybody if we cook only healthy food.
        </p>


        <p>
            Because the other people want to eat cakes and salads with mayonnaise and we should not to decide instead
            of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I think, we should cook not only healthy food, so that everyone will be happy.
            By the way, when do you invited my parent for the dinner?

        <h3>September 5, 2019</h3>
        <p>I donâ€™t like my job, because it has no sense. It is not good for children, it is not interesting for me and
            it repeats every year. Today I saw a math teacher, who quite a couple of years ago. So, she looked very
            happy. She was driving her bike with basket, and definitely does not think how to teach children that they
            do not need at all. I think the most problem of Belarusian education, that teachers have no any motivation
            to teach and students have no motivation to study. Because of this all sense of education is lost.
